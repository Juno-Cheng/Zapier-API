# Zapier Automation for File Upload

This script automates the process of zipping a directory of extracted files and uploading the zipped file to Zapier via a webhook. It is designed to run weekly, zipping the specified folder and triggering the Zapier workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.0+
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `zipfile`, `schedule`

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Required Python Libraries

To install the necessary libraries, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install requests schedule
```

### Step 2: Adjust Script Configuration

1. **Webhook URL:**
   - Update the `webhook_url` variable in the script to your Zapier webhook URL.

   ```python
   webhook_url = 'https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/your-webhook-id/'
   ```

2. **File Paths:**
   - Ensure the `folder_path` and `zip_file_path` variables are set to the correct directories where your extracted files are stored and where the zipped file will be saved.

   ```python
   folder_path = '/path/to/your/extracted/files'
   zip_file_path = '/path/to/your/zip/ScrapedData.zip'
   ```

### Step 3: Placement of Script

This script must be placed in the same directory as the folder containing your extracted files to ensure the paths are correctly resolved, or ensure the `folder_path` is correctly pointing to the extracted files.

## Usage

### Running the Script

The script is designed to run continuously, checking every minute if itâ€™s time to execute the weekly task (every Monday at noon). To start the script, simply run:

```bash
python3 Upload.py
```

### Keeping the Script Running

- **Leave the Script Running:** For the script to function properly, it needs to be running continuously. It is recommended to run this on a server or a machine that remains on for extended periods.
- **Automating Startup (Optional):** You can set up your operating system to run this script automatically on startup using tools like `cron` (on Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). Refer to your OS documentation for instructions.
